Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the  <a href='https://cs.wisc.edu/'>Department of Computer Sciences</a>
at the <a href='https://www.wisc.edu/'>University of Wisconsin- Madison</a>, supervised by <a href='https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/'>Prof. Yong Jae Lee</a>. I got my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2020. My research interest lies in the intersection of deep learning and computer vision. 
I am especially interested in 3D scene understanding and self-supervised learning.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
