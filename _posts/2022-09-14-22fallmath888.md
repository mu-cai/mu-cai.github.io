## Homework 1

### Who am I?
Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the  <a href='https://cs.wisc.edu/'>Department of Computer Sciences</a>
at the <a href='https://www.wisc.edu/'>University of Wisconsin- Madison</a>, supervised by <a href='https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/'>Prof. Yong Jae Lee</a>. I got my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2020. My research interest lies in the intersection of deep learning and computer vision. 
I am especially interested in 3D scene understanding and self-supervised learning.

### What are my professional preparation/interests, background, and goals?
<!-- ### What are my professional interests or goals? -->
I am a Ph.D. student with a computer science background. I am also interested in mathematics-driven data science, 
where math (will) become my minor. Most of the time, I use deep learning, the well-known black box but powerful
tool, to empirically improve the performance of computer vision problems.
 I am passionate about solving 
**real world** problems that better serve people, such as 3D perception in autonomous driving.
However, current deep learning-based approaches may not reveal
 the underline relationship between objects and labels. For example, recent studies found that
 the irrelevant background could be an informative feature when recognizing the foreground objects,
 known as <a href="http://lgmoneda.github.io/2021/01/12/spurious-correlation-ml-and-causality.html">supurious correlation</a>.
A straightforward idea is: can we use the well-established causal inference to help improve the reliability of deep learning?

<!-- <div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> -->
  <!-- <div class="row">
    <div class="col one"> -->
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/sup_cor.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


### Why am I interested in causal inference?
Therefore, the causal inference may provide us with a way to build an interpretable 
computer vision framework. Other areas, such as vision-question-answering (VQA),
can also be equipped with causal inference to improve both final performance and 
interpretation.
