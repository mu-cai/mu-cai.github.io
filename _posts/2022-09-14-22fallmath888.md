## Homework 1

### Who am I?
Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the  <a href='https://cs.wisc.edu/'>Department of Computer Sciences</a>
at the <a href='https://www.wisc.edu/'>University of Wisconsin- Madison</a>, supervised by <a href='https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/'>Prof. Yong Jae Lee</a>. I got my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2020. My research interest lies in the intersection of deep learning and computer vision. 
I am especially interested in 3D scene understanding and self-supervised learning.

</div>

### What is my professional preparation and background?

I am a Ph.D. student from computer science background. I am also interested in mathematics driven data science, 
where math (will) become my minor. During most of my time, I use deep learing, the well-known black box but powerful
tool, to empirically improve the performance of computer vision problems.

### What is my professional interests or goals?
 I am passionate about solving 
**real world** problems that better serve people, such as 3D perception in autonomous driving.
However, current deep learning based  approaches may not reveal
 the underline relationship of objects and label. For example, recently studies found that
 the unrelavant background could be the informative features when recognnizing the foreground objects,
 know as <a href="http://lgmoneda.github.io/2021/01/12/spurious-correlation-ml-and-causality.html">supurious correlation</a>.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/sup_cor.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

A straightforward idea is: can we use the well-established causal inference to
help improve the reliability of deep learning? 

### Why am I interested in causal inference?
Therefore, causal inference may provide us a way to build a interpretable 
computer vision framework. Other areas, such as vision-question-answering (VQA),
can also be equiped with causal inference to  improve both final performance and 
interpretation.
